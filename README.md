# SASS BEM Bootstrap 4

This is just a practice for SASS BEM Bootstrap 4.
This also uses very simple webpack and brower-sync.

For a quick spin, just run in your CLI:
```
npm start
```
This will start webpack (converts sass file into css, into bundle.js) and will open brower-sync at the same time on localhost:3000 automatically.

For sass preprocessing, run below in your CLI. This will start webpack --watch
```
npm start
```
